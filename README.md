# CaMP-Calcs
bulk density curves and gap-filling of peat databases for CaMP

Currently a holding place for a few functions used in prior work:

1) the standard bulk density curves (both data and reproducible function) from the CaMP paper (10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2020.109164)

2) Gap filling the total carbon and bulk density values for the larger composite peat database to be published in 2023

Right now the R script does the work, but could convert to something more literate as required.  Basic csvs stored in here as well.

The .xlsx file shows the results of the interim gap-filling data in Feb 2021 and is provided here as an archive, and will be superceded by the 2023 release.
